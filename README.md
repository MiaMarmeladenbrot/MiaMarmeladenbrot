### Hey everyone, Iâ€™m Mia! ðŸ‘‹
After pursuing my passion for storytelling as a non-fiction editor, I decided to embark on a new path in 2023. Through enrollment in a Full-Stack Bootcamp by SuperCode and extensive autodidactic learning I turned my love for creative thinking and problem-solving into a career as a front-end developer. While this journey sometimes resembled a rollercoaster ride, I am incredibly grateful that I started it. As someone inherently curious and eager to learn, experiencing this impressive learning curve over the last months has been amazing. I love that I am constantly progressing and expanding my skill set.
